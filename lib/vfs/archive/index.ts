/**
 * Project archive: a project as a browsable zip, and the way back in.
 *
 * The import path is three steps that stay separate on purpose — read, analyze, apply. Reading
 * turns a zip or a dropped folder into `ArchiveEntry[]`; analyzing produces a plan and writes
 * nothing; applying carries out a plan the user has approved. Nothing in the middle step touches
 * storage, which is what lets the preview be trusted.
