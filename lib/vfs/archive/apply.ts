 * Carry out a plan the user has approved.

 *    `plan.files.conflicts`, `plan.settingChanges` or the backend buckets. An entry the analyzer
 *    refused is still in `entries` — apply never looks at it. A record the *project* has and the
 *    archive does not is in none of the buckets and is left exactly alone: an import populates,
 *    it never reconciles deletions.
 *
 * 2. **Nothing is deleted, and nothing is deleted-then-created.** A failed re-create after a
 *    delete would lose the original, and no outcome here is worth that trade; 'keep both' writes
 *    a second path rather than moving the first.
 *
 * 3. **One failure does not cost the rest of the import.** Each write is wrapped, the failure is
 *    tallied into `result.failed` with its reason, and the loop continues — matching the folder
 *    drop and `skills/service.ts`, not the abort-on-first-error of `.osws`/`.oswt`. What comes
 *    back is a report against the plan the user approved: what applied, what did not, and why.
 *
 * The one thing that *is* fatal is a failed checkpoint on an existing project (below).
 *
 * **What the checkpoint does and does not cover.** `restoreCheckpoint` restores files and
 * directories, and the backend records and covered settings too
 * (`lib/vfs/checkpoint-backend.ts`), so an import is one undo. The exception is a secret's stored
 * value, which a checkpoint deliberately never holds: replacing a secret is the one write here
 * that cannot be undone. That, plus the fact that an archive carries no old code either, is why
 * nothing replaces a record the user did not explicitly resolve to 'replace', and why 'keep both'
 * writes a second record instead.
 *
 * Backend features are written through the storage adapter and never through the `/.server/`
 * mount: `mountProjectBackendContext` returns immediately unless `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_MODE` is
 * 'true' (index.ts:236), which is the default deployment mode, so a mount-based write throws for
 * most users. Bypassing the mount also bypasses its validation, so every record goes through the
 * same exported validator the mount would have used before it reaches storage.
