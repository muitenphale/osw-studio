 * name is written NFD in one place and NFC in the other — macOS versus everywhere else — so apply
 * must resolve a plan path back to its `ArchiveEntry` under `path.normalize('NFC')` rather than by
 * string equality. A plain lookup misses the entry for exactly those files, and writing the
 * archive's spelling instead would create a duplicate beside the file it meant to replace.
 *
 * **Backend, for apply.** `backend.added`, `backend.conflicts` and `backend.unchanged` partition
 * every function the archive carries. A record in none of the three is one the *project* has and
 * the archive does not: leave it alone — an import populates, it never reconciles. `secretsAdded`
 * and `secretsMetadataChanged` likewise list only what apply must write; a secret in neither is
