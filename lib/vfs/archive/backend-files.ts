 * Editable source files → parsed backend records.

 * writing to `/.server/…` throws. The caller persists these through the storage adapter instead.
 *
 * Bypassing the mount also bypasses its validation, so each composed record goes through the same
 * exported validator the mount would have used. A record that fails is dropped and reported: a
 * half-formed edge function in storage is worse than an absent one the user can see was rejected.
 *
 * A value present in the archive reaches the validator untouched. Only an **absent** key takes a
 * default — defaulting a malformed one hides it, and `"enabled": "false"` arriving as
 * `enabled: true` publishes a route the archive says is off.
 *
 * Prose in `/.server/` is ignored, which is what lets the generated README.md round-trip.
 *
 * `claimedPaths` is every `/.server/` path this recognized as its own, whether it composed a record
 * or reported an issue about it. A caller that routed the whole folder here can subtract it to find
 * the entries nothing accounted for — those are dropped, and the user was told the folder was
 * theirs to edit.
 *
 * **At most one record per (kind, name).** A record's name comes from its sidecar's `name` field
 * when it has one, and the list files are plain JSON arrays, so two records of the same kind can
 * claim one name in a single archive — `a.json` and `b.json` both saying `"name": "send-email"`,
 * or `secrets.json` listing `API_KEY` twice. Nothing downstream can carry that: a name is the only
 * identity an archive has, so the analyzer would classify one entry twice and apply would try to
 * store both, the second failing on the adapter's uniqueness constraint. First wins, and the loser
 * is reported — the same treatment the zip and folder readers give a duplicate path.
