/**
 * Review sessions for anonymous visitors of a review copy.

 * A deployment id is a UUID but not a secret, and display names are typed by hand, so neither can
 * identify a commenter. Comments are attributed to a participant id the server generates and returns
 * in a signed cookie; nothing a client sends is trusted as a participant id.
 *
 * SESSION_SECRET is shared with the account session in lib/auth/session.ts, so the two token families
 * are told apart in both directions: a `purpose: 'review'` claim is required here, and verifySession
 * refuses any token carrying a `purpose` at all.
 *
 * A session also carries the deployment it was minted for and an epoch derived from the review
 * password, both checked on verify, so a cookie is worthless against another deployment and stops
 * working the moment the owner changes the gate.
