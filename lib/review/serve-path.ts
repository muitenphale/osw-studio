/**
 * Turning a review URL's path segments into a file inside the review build.
 *
 * The public deployment route can join its segments onto a directory and read whatever comes out,
 * because that directory is a published web root and every file in it is already public. A review
 * build is not: it sits beside the per-deployment databases, outside `public/`, and is reached by a
 * caller who needed no account. So the join has to be contained.
 *
 * Containment cannot be delegated upstream. Next percent-decodes each dynamic segment after it has
 * normalized the request path, so `%2e%2e%2f` arrives as one segment whose text is `../` — the
 * router never saw a `..` segment to strip, and the traversal reaches this code intact.
