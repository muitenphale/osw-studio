/**
 * Compile-time provenance for the preview.
 *
 * Inserts `data-osw-src="<path>:<index>"` into element open tags so a rendered element can name the
 * source that produced it.
 *
 * **Value format.** `<path>:<index>`. A path may itself contain `:`, so a consumer must split on the
 * *last* colon — `v.slice(0, v.lastIndexOf(':'))` and `v.slice(v.lastIndexOf(':') + 1)` — never
 * `split(':')`.
 *
 * **Why code units.** `<index>` is a UTF-16 code-unit index into the file's string content. File
 * content is a JS string throughout the compile pipeline and `slice`/`indexOf` are code-unit
 * indexed, so a byte or code-point offset would desynchronise on the first non-ASCII character. The
 * built-in templates are full of them.
 *
 * **Path escaping is one-way.** A `"` in `filePath` is escaped to `&quot;` so it cannot terminate
 * the attribute, and nothing reverses it. A path containing `"` therefore does not round-trip, and a
 * consumer must not assume the emitted path compares equal to the VFS path. No VFS path contains `"`
 * today.
 *
 * Preview-only instrumentation. It must never reach project source or published output; see the
 * `provenance` option on VirtualServer, which is off unless the preview asks for it.
 *
 * Intended consumers, none of which import this yet — they arrive in later units: the preview's
 * selector and placement scripts, which strip the attribute out of everything the agent sees, and
 * `curl -o`, which is the one path that writes compiled HTML back into project source.
