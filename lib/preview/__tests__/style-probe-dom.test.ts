/**
 * The probe — rank every declaration of a property, and see whether ours is the one that wins —
 * run out of the *emitted* text.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT in this file, and why
 *
 * **jsdom's own cascade detects exactly one loss: an inline `style` attribute.** Measured, not
 * reasoned: jsdom ranks specificity above importance, so the override's doubled `(0,2,0)` selector
 * beats an `!important` rule and beats `#id` there. The probe no longer *reads* jsdom's cascade —
 * it ranks declarations itself with {@link __oswBeats}, which gets importance right — but the
 * assertions in this file still have to be ones a reader can confirm against the environment, so
 * the full matrix of what beats an override lives in `e2e/style-probe.test.ts` and runs in Chrome.
 *
 * What jsdom *can* prove is exactly the part that was wrong: an override whose value agrees with
 * what the element already had is **in force**, not lost. That is a property of the ranking, not of
 * the engine, and it is checked below.
