/**
 * The Elements tree serializer, as JavaScript source for injection into the preview iframe.
 *
 * The host cannot read the frame's `contentDocument`, so the tree has to be built inside the frame
 * and posted up. That means this cannot be an imported module — it is interpolated into the script
 * template literals in `components/preview/multipage-preview.tsx`. It is authored here, as a
 * constant, for the reason `STRIP_PROVENANCE_JS` and `STRIP_NODE_ID_JS` are: the emitted text is the
 * only thing that runs, and the tests can execute *this* string.
 *
 * **No regex literals.** Anything hand-written inside those template literals loses one level of
 * escaping before it is emitted — `\s` becomes a literal `s`, a live bug at
 * `multipage-preview.tsx:370`. An interpolated constant is inserted verbatim and would be safe, but
 * this file avoids regexes entirely so the hazard cannot be reintroduced by the next edit: source
 * values are split with `lastIndexOf`/`slice` and compared as strings.
 *
 * ## Addressing
 *
 * Nodes are stamped `data-osw-node="<n>"` as they are serialized and resolved later with
 * `document.querySelector('[data-osw-node="17"]')`. Deliberately **not** a `Map` from id to element:
 * a map never releases a removed element, so a stale id resolves to a *detached* node —
 * `positionOverlay` then draws a 1x1 overlay at (0,0) and `buildDomPath` walks to a non-document
 * root, producing a path that resolves to nothing or to a different element. `querySelector`
 * returns `null`, which is the stale signal the panel wants.
 *
 * An element that is already stamped keeps its id. Re-expanding a level the panel has collapsed must
 * not strand an id the host is still holding for an element that never changed.
 *
 * ## What is in the tree
 *
 * Only elements carrying `data-osw-src`. `injectProvenance` tags every authored element and never
 * tags `script` or `style`, so this one rule excludes the selector overlay, the placement indicator
 * and its placeholders, the two scripts before `</body>`, and the head-injected marker and blob-map
 * scripts — without the serializer having to recognise each piece of furniture individually.
 *
 * The tradeoff, stated rather than hidden: legitimately JS-built elements are absent from the tree
 * too. They have no source to annotate and no source to edit, so a row for them would be a row the
 * rest of the feature cannot act on. Bundled runtimes (react, preact, svelte, vue) emit no
 * provenance at all, so their tree is empty; that is the panel's business to report.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * The shared-source counts come from a single `querySelectorAll('[data-osw-src]')` per call, reused
 * for every node in the level. Counting per node — as `buildSelectionPayload` does for its one
 * element — would be up to 200 full-document queries per expansion, on the main thread, inside the
 * frame the user is looking at.
 *
 * Emits `{ nodes, truncated }` matching {@link SerializedLevel}; each node matches {@link TreeNode}.
