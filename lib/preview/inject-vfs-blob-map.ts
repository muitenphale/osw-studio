/**
 * Put the blob-URL map where a compiled page's asset interceptor can find it.
 *
 * The interceptor resolves runtime requests — a `fetch`, a script setting `img.src` — through
 * `window.__oswVfsBlobUrls`. Compiled pages do not carry the map themselves: it is identical for
 * every page, so a project of several hundred pages used to hold several hundred copies of it.
 * Whoever renders a compiled page supplies it instead, which means every renderer has to, and a
 * renderer that forgets loses runtime assets with no error and nothing to search for.
 *
 * Used by the thumbnail capture. `components/preview/multipage-preview.tsx` builds the same script
 * inline because it injects it together with its per-load marker; the two have to stay in step.
