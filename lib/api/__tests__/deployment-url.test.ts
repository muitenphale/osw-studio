/**
 * Why this exists.
 *
 * `resolveDeploymentServing` was already covered exhaustively by static-builder-serving.test.ts,
 * including the case where a slug exists but the proxy is off. It still shipped a broken URL,
 * because the deployment card and the publish settings tab never called it: both built
 * `https://${slug}.${hostname}` by hand, and publish assigns a slug unconditionally. On a local
 * install that is `https://some-slug.localhost`, which resolves to nothing.
 *
 * So these do not re-test the resolver. They pin the thing that was actually missing: the value the
 * API hands the UI, for the environments the UI runs in.
