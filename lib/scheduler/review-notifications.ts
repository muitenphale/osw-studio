/**
 * The sweep that turns owed review digests into queued mail.
 *
 * Composition decides (lib/review/digest.ts); this commits. Nothing here touches the network: a
 * finished message goes into the outbox and the pass ends, and delivery drains it on its own
 * schedule.
 *
 * Whether anything is composed is decided here, by two gates. The deployment's own Email
 * notifications switch is the first; whether the workspace's mail is switched on and has a server
 * behind it is the second, and the difference between them is that the second one advances every
 * recipient's watermark on the way past. A channel that is closed does not keep a backlog to
 * release when it opens.
 *
 * Two more things shape the code more than the rest.
 *
 * A review database is *created* by opening it, `getReviewDatabaseConnection` runs `ensureDir` and
 * `new Database(...)`. A task that iterated every deployment and opened one would leave an empty
 * review.sqlite in the directory of every deployment on the instance, including the ones whose
 * owner never enabled review. So the deployment record is read first and decides whether this
 * deployment is in scope at all.
 *
 * And the watermark advance has to be tied to the outbox insert. They live in different SQLite
 * files, so one transaction over both is not available; what is available is running the insert
 * inside the review database's transaction, which is the direction that matters, see `commit`.
