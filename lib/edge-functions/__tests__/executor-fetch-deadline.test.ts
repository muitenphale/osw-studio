/**
 * An outbound request is bounded by the invoking function's remaining budget, not by a constant.
 *
 * The cap used to be a flat 10s while a function may run for 30s, so a slow upstream was aborted
 * well inside the budget it had been given. Model calls hit this routinely: the same question would
 * answer in 6s and abort at 10.1s on the next attempt.
 *
 * The bound is easy to reintroduce because nothing fails loudly when it is wrong. The executor's own
 * loop also gives up at the deadline, so a function with a hanging fetch ends either way. What
 * separates the two is whether the *request* was aborted, so that is what these assert rather than
 * how long `executeFunction` took.
