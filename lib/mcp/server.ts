const BASH_DESCRIPTION = `Run a command against a project's files, exactly as the OSW Studio agent does.

Commands: cat, head, tail, ls, tree, grep, rg, find, wc, sort, uniq, tr, echo, mkdir, rmdir, touch, mv, cp, rm, sed, ss, curl, runtime.
Pipes, redirects (> file, >> file), heredocs (<< 'EOF'), chaining (&&, ||, ;) and brace expansion are supported.

curl localhost/ renders a page through the project's compiler, which is how to check output without publishing.

Not available here: build, python, python3 and lua need the browser runtime, and sqlite3 needs a deployment selected in the app. Use deployments_sql for a deployment's database. status is the in-app agent's task-completion command and does nothing for an outside client.

Read a file: cat /index.html
Create a file: cat > /about.html << 'EOF'\ncontent\nEOF
Edit a file: ss /index.html << 'EOF'\nsearch\n=======\nreplacement\nEOF

Reading needs projects:read; anything that writes needs projects:write.`;

/**
 * The MCP server an outside agent talks to. One instance per request (the transport is
 * stateless), built for the principal the bearer token resolved to. Every tool is a thin call
 * to the same workspace adapter the app's own routes use, behind the same role check.
 *
 * Tools that need no provider API key run server-side here. The agent tools are the exception:
 * a provider key lives in the browser's localStorage and is never stored server-side, so a task
 * on a cloud provider cannot be started from here. See `agent_run` for what it does instead.
