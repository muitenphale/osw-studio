/**
 * Which paths reach the middleware at all.
 *
 * A preview iframe sends every asset reference the VFS interceptor misses to this app, and a
 * project referencing files it does not contain turns those into a stream of requests that can only
 * 404. Running each one through the session check costs a JWT verification, so static-asset
 * extensions are excluded from the matcher.
 *
 * These assertions are on the pattern, not on Next's routing: they catch an extension being dropped
 * from the list or the negative lookahead being broken. That the pattern is applied to the pathname
 * rather than the full URL, so a query string does not defeat the `$` anchor, was verified against a
 * running server instead.
