# Deployment Publishing

Publish and configure deployments directly from OSW Studio in **Server Mode**.

---

## Overview

Server Mode lets you publish static sites directly from your OSW Studio instance. Each deployment gets its own URL, configurable settings for analytics, SEO, compliance, and more.

**Key Features:**
- **One-click publishing** - Compile and deploy instantly
- **Deployment settings** - Scripts, CDN resources, analytics
- **SEO optimization** - Meta tags, Open Graph, sitemaps
- **Compliance** - Cookie consent, GDPR/CCPA banners
- **Custom domains** - Use your own domain (advanced)

---

## Creating a Deployment

### From Projects View

1. Right-click on a project card
2. Select **"Create Deployment"**
3. Enter deployment name
4. Click **"Create Deployment"**

### From Deployments View

1. Click **"+ New Deployment"** button
2. Select source project
3. Enter deployment details
4. Click **"Create Deployment"**

---

## Publishing Workflow

1. Create/edit deployment settings
2. Click **"Save & Close"**
3. Click **"Publish Now"** (or right-click deployment → Publish)
4. Static builder runs:
   - Loads project files from server
   - Compiles Handlebars templates (partials from `/templates/`, context from `/data.json`)
   - Uses pre-built `bundle.js` for framework runtimes (React, Preact, Svelte, Vue)
   - Rewrites internal links to include `/deployments/{id}/` prefix
   - Injects configured settings (scripts, analytics, SEO)
   - Generates sitemap.xml and robots.txt
   - Writes to `/public/deployments/{id}/`
5. Site is live!

**Note**: Python and Lua projects cannot be published — they run only in the browser's WASM runtime. Use ZIP export for offline distribution instead.

### Accessing Published Deployments

**Default URL:**
```
https://your-osw-instance.com/deployments/{id}/
```

**Clean URLs** (Next.js rewrites):
```
/deployments/{id}/about → /deployments/{id}/about.html
/deployments/{id}/blog/post → /deployments/{id}/blog/post.html
```

## Managing Deployments

### Deployment Actions

Right-click any deployment card for actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **View Live** | Open published site in new tab |
| **Settings** | Configure deployment options |
| **Republish** | Rebuild and deploy |
| **Copy Link** | Copy deployment URL to clipboard |
| **View Source** | Open source project |
| **Analytics** | View deployment analytics dashboard |
| **Capture Thumbnail** | Update preview image |
| **Unpublish** | Take the site off traffic, keeping the deployment and its data |
| **Delete** | Permanently remove deployment |

### Unpublish vs Delete

- **Unpublish**: Removes the published files, so the site stops answering. Its edge functions stop
  answering too, and its scheduled functions stop running. The deployment keeps its settings, its
  database and its analytics, and it keeps its address, so publishing again puts the same site back
  at the same URL.
  Pages are served with an hour of cache, so a visitor who loaded the site recently may still see it
  from their own browser cache for up to that long.
- **Delete**: Permanently removes the deployment, its settings, its database and its analytics. The
  address is released, so a later deployment of the same project gets a different one.

### Version Tracking

Each deployment shows:
- **Settings Version**: Current configuration version
- **Published Version**: Last published version

If these differ, the deployment has unpublished changes.

## Custom Domains

Use a custom domain (e.g., `sweetcandies.com`) for your published deployment. Enter the domain in Deployment Settings, add a DNS A record, and publish. See [Custom Domains Guide](CUSTOM_DOMAINS.md) for full details.

## Troubleshooting

### Publishing Errors

**Symptoms**: Deployment not building, empty `/public/deployments/`

**Solutions**:
1. Check build logs in terminal
2. Verify project has files synced to server
3. Check Handlebars syntax in templates
4. Verify disk permissions:
   ```bash
   ls -la public/
   chmod 755 public/
   ```
5. Check available disk space:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

### Deployment Not Updating After Republish

**Symptoms**: Changes not showing on published site

**Solutions**:
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check `settingsVersion` vs `lastPublishedVersion` in deployment card
3. Verify "Publish" was clicked (not just "Save")
4. Check build succeeded in terminal logs
5. Inspect HTML source for changes
6. Clear CDN cache (if using one)

### Custom Domain Not Working

See troubleshooting section in [Custom Domains Guide](CUSTOM_DOMAINS.md#troubleshooting).
