/**
 * The tab strip, rendered.
 *
 * There is no React Testing Library here, and this is the one thing in the panel that a pure
 * function cannot cover: the failure being guarded against is *structural* — the panel used to
 * return early four times before its body, so a tab strip added around "the body" disappears in
 * every state but the happy one, and no assertion about a helper function would notice.
 *
 * `renderToStaticMarkup` is enough for that: effects do not run, nothing is clicked, and the only
 * questions asked are "is this element in the output" — which is exactly the question. Everything
 * behavioural about the panel lives in `reduceTree` and `reduceStyles` and is tested there. What
 * remains out of reach here is the half of the controlled contract that needs an event: that a
 * press reports upward instead of switching the tab locally. That is `controlled-tab.test.tsx`.
