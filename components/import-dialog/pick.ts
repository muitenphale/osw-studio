/**
 * Opening the OS folder picker and turning what comes back into an import source.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in either caller because both surfaces need it and both need it to
 * mean the same thing — in particular the stripped root segment below, which decides whether a
 * manifest is found at all. Two copies of that rule would eventually disagree.
 *
 * There is no React input for this: `webkitdirectory` is a DOM property with no JSX attribute, so
 * the element is built by hand. It is never attached to the document; a detached input still opens
 * the picker, and nothing else in the app needs to see it.
