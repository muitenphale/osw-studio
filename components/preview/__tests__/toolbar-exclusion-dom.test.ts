/**
 * The toolbar is inside the user's document, so every consumer of that document can see it.
 *
 * That is the price of the in-frame architecture, and this file is where it is paid. Each test here
 * pins one consumer that would otherwise treat preview furniture as the user's own content: the
 * drop-target scan, the selector's hover, the selector's click, and the frame-wide click relay.
 *
 * **Both frame scripts are installed**, because that is how they run in production — the placement
 * script and the navigation script are two sibling `<script>` blocks in the same `srcdoc`, each a
 * self-contained IIFE, sharing nothing but the document. The toolbar is mounted by the navigation
 * script and read by the placement script, so a test of the exclusion with only one of them loaded
 * would be testing a document that never exists.
 *
 * One instance of each, for the whole file: every `new Function(...)` run installs another `message`
 * listener on the same jsdom window, and a second would double every reply.
 *
 * Three things jsdom does not do, measured here rather than assumed:
 *
 * - **no layout** — every `getBoundingClientRect()` is zeros, and the toolbar refuses a zero-size
 *   element, so without a stub nothing would ever mount and every test below would pass vacuously.
 * - **no `document.elementFromPoint`** — it is not merely null, it is *not a function*, so
 *   `findDropTarget` throws without a stub. Stubbed to null, which is what a real browser returns for
 *   a point over bare body — and the fallback that null selects is exactly the defect in row 1.
 * - **shadow events need `composed: true`** — an event dispatched inside a shadow root with the
 *   default `composed: false` does not cross the boundary at all, so a document listener never sees
 *   it. A real user's click is composed; the tests below say so explicitly.
