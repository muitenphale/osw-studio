/**
 * Getting the toolbar back after a recompile.
 *
 * Every `srcdoc` reassignment mints a new document, and it takes the toolbar, the tracked element
 * and every `nodeId` with it. This is not an edge case in this feature: pressing `Style` flips
 * `provenance={showElements}`, which forces exactly that recompile — so the *first* press of the
 * toolbar's primary action always destroys the toolbar, and the only way it comes back is the
 * frame-ready handshake the host already runs (`focusReloadAction` → `selection-resolve`).
 *
 * There is no new message here, and that is the point: `selection-resolve` reaches
 * `buildSelectionPayload`, which is the one place the toolbar is anchored. The thing worth pinning
 * is that the round trip re-anchors to the *new* element rather than leaving the frame holding the
 * detached one it was closed over.
 *
 * **The teardown is asserted before the recovery in every test below.** "The toolbar is there after
 * the reload" is satisfied by a toolbar that was never taken down, so without proving the absence
 * first these tests would pass against an implementation that does nothing at all.
 *
 * jsdom has no layout, so the rect is stubbed — the toolbar refuses a zero-size element, and
 * unstubbed nothing would ever mount.
