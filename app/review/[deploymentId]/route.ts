/**
 * Review copy — entry point.
 *
 * The door a client comes through. They have no OSW Studio account and never will: they were sent a
 * link, and possibly a password, by the agency whose workspace owns the deployment. Getting past
 * here mints the review session that the sibling serving route then checks on every asset.
 *
 * Every refusal is a 404, including a wrong password on a review that has closed and a deployment
 * whose review was switched off. That matches the posture in lib/api/deployment-access.ts: a caller
 * with no claim on a deployment should not be able to tell it apart from one that does not exist.
