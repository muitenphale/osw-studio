 * Membership check for every page under /w/{workspaceId}.
 *
 * The middleware guards these paths, but it runs on the Edge runtime and the access tables live in
 * SQLite, so all it can establish is that the session is valid. A signed-in user could therefore
 * load another workspace's URL and get the shell. Nothing leaked: the client reads its own
 * cookie-scoped IndexedDB, and every route under /api/w/{id} goes through getWorkspaceContext. But
 * the page rendered, which reads as access.
 *
 * A layout is the one place this can be done once for all nine pages, and it is a server component,
 * so the lookup the middleware cannot make is available here.
 *
 * A refused workspace sends the user to their own rather than to an error: arriving at a workspace
 * you are not in is almost always a stale link or a bookmark from a revoked membership.
