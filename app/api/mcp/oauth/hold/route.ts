/**
 * Holding an authorization request across the gateway login.
 *
 * On a hosted instance the consent screen cannot simply bounce a signed-out visitor to
 * `/admin/login?next=...`: middleware sends `/admin/login` on to the gateway, which has no notion of
 * a destination — its login always lands on `/account`, and the handoff it builds afterwards names
 * `/w/{id}/dashboard`. The authorization request was dropped there, so the client sat at its
 * redirect URI waiting for a callback that never came, which looks like a hang rather than an error.
 *
 * Rather than teach the gateway to carry a destination — a path on an instance it only picks later,
 * which it would then have to validate against the user's own instances — the request is held here,
 * in a short-lived cookie on the instance's own origin. It survives the round trip because the
 * browser comes back to this same host, and `middleware.ts` spends it on the way in.
 *
 * The cookie holds only the query the client itself sent, and it is spent on the consent screen,
 * which re-validates `client_id` and `redirect_uri` before anything is shown. So the worst a crafted
 * link achieves is a consent screen the visitor must still approve — the same as sending them to
 * `/mcp/authorize` directly.
