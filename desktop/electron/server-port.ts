/**
 * The port the desktop app serves on.
 *
 * It used to ask for the first free port in [30011, 50000]. In practice that returned 30011 every
 * time, because the range is scanned from its start, so the app was already stable there by
 * accident. Two things made that worth pinning down:
 *
 * - An MCP connector is registered against a URL. If the port moves, the connector stops reaching
 *   the app, and nothing said so.
 * - The old range ran to 50000, past the start of the ephemeral range macOS allocates outgoing
 *   connections from (49152). A port taken from there can collide with an ephemeral allocation.
 *
 * 30011 stays the number: it is unassigned in the IANA registry, it is not a port development
 * tooling reaches for, and it is below the ephemeral floor on both macOS (49152) and Linux
 * (32768). The fallback range stays below 32768 for the same reason.
 *
 * `OSW_DESKTOP_PORT` overrides it, for running two instances or dodging a conflict.
